<h2> What is it? </h2>
      A chamoy pickle is a remarkable creation that has stumped historians since its inception. What is this bright red pickle that tastes so majestic?
</p>
<p>It's actually quite simple. Take any old dill pickle, just your average joe, and soak it in a mixture of chamoy, Tajin, and sour candy powders. And, of course, some Red 40. Voila!
