<h2> What is it and what's the lore? </h2>
      A chamoy pickle is a remarkable creation that has stumped historians since its inception. What is this bright red pickle that tastes so majestic?
<br>
It's actually quite simple. Take any old dill pickle, just your average joe, and soak it in a mixture of chamoy, Tajin, and sour candy powders. And, of course, some Red 40. Voila!
If you're not sure what chamoy or Tajin are, Chamoy is a Mexican sauce made of dehydrated fruits, and Tajin is a Mexican spice made with a mixture of pepper, lime, and salt.

<br>
But you may be confused: sure, it sounds interesting, but how did this mysterious invention come to light? And what makes it so special?
<br>
The chamoy pickle became popular on Tik Tok. The pickle lore has to do with the combination of crazy flavors, bright colors, and the mess involved. To eat it properly, it should be stuffed with a variety of gummy candies and chips and be coated with even more chamoy. The more mess, the better the pickle! Finally, the sheer bucketload of Red 40 in the mixture helped draw attention to the pickle.

    <h2> Ingredients and Formation</h2>
    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Chamoy Pickle Kit </li>
    </ul>
    OR
    <ul>
      <li> Chamoy Pickle </li>
      <li> Takis </li>
      <li> Gushers </li>
      <li> Silly Spaghetti </li>
      <li> Fruit Roll Up </li>
      <li> Chamoy Sauce </li>
      <li> Sour Powder </li>
    </ul>
    <h3> Formation </h3>
    To form the chamoy pickle, start by cutting off the top of the pickle and hollowing out a hole in the center so it is open like a bowl. Then stuff the silly spaghetti into the bottom of this hole. Follow it by adding in the gushers and takis (I would recommend being generous with the takis). Then wrap the fruit roll up on the outside of the pickle as if it is wearing a scarf. Finally, squeeze some chamoy sauce over it and sprinkle on some sour powder and the creation is complete!

  <h2> Reviews </h2>
  The chamoy pickle has mixed reviews. Some people are against the crazy combination of flavors and find that they don't mix well. If you don't like pickles or spicy foods, the chamoy pickle is definitely not for you. However, other disagree with this assessment and find the flavors mix well together, with the sweetness of the candy balancing the sour spiciness of the other ingredients. And some say that the pickle is not bad, but nothing special.

  <h2> Where to Buy </h2>
  If you buy all the ingredients separately, the pickle can be constructed with food from most grocery stores.
<br>
  However, the pickle kit can also be bought all in one. Because this interesting pickle surfaced on tik tok, most people buy the chamoy pickle kit off the tik tok shop. However, since not all of us have tik tok nor want to give it even more private information, you can also buy it on Amazon at a scarily high price!
