<h2> What is it and what's the lore? </h2>
      A chamoy pickle is a remarkable creation that has stumped historians since its inception. What is this bright red pickle that tastes so majestic?
<br>
It's actually quite simple. Take any old dill pickle, just your average joe, and soak it in a mixture of chamoy, Tajin, and sour candy powders. And, of course, some Red 40. Voila!
If you're not sure what chamoy or Tajin are, Chamoy is a Mexican sauce made of dehydrated fruits, and Tajin is a Mexican spice made with a mixture of pepper, lime, and salt.

But you may be confused: sure, it sounds interesting, but how did this mysterious invention come to light? And what makes it so special?
