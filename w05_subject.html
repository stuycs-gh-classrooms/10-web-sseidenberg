<h2> What is it and what's the lore? </h2>
      A chamoy pickle is a remarkable creation that has stumped historians since its inception. What is this bright red pickle that tastes so majestic?
<br>
It's actually quite simple. Take any old dill pickle, just your average joe, and soak it in a mixture of chamoy, Tajin, and sour candy powders. And, of course, some Red 40. Voila!
If you're not sure what chamoy or Tajin are, Chamoy is a Mexican sauce made of dehydrated fruits, and Tajin is a Mexican spice made with a mixture of pepper, lime, and salt.

<br>
But you may be confused: sure, it sounds interesting, but how did this mysterious invention come to light? And what makes it so special?
<br>
The chamoy pickle became popular on Tik Tok. The pickle lore has to do with the combination of crazy flavors, bright mess, and the mess involved. To eat it properly, it should be stuffed with a variety of gummy candies and chips and be coated with even more chamoy. The more mess, the better the pickle!

      <li> Chamoy Pickle </li>
      <li> Takis </li>
      <li> Gushers </li>

      <li> Fruit Roll Up </li>
      <li> Chamoy Sauce </li>
      <li> Sour Powder </li>
    </ul>
    <h3> Formation </h3>
    To form the chamoy pickle, start by cutting off the top of the pickle and hollowing out a hole in the center so it is open like a bowl. Then stuff the silly spaghetti into the bottom of this hole. Follow it by adding in the gushers and takis (I would reccomend being generous with the takis). Then wrap the fruit roll up on the outside of the pickle as if it is wearing a scarf. Finally, squeeze some chamoy sauce over it and sprinkle on some sour powder and the creation is complete!
