    The chamoy pickle has mixed reviews. Some people are against the crazy combination of flavors and find that they don't mix well. If you don't like pickles or spicy foods, the chamoy pickle is definitely not for you. However, other disagree with this assessment and find the flavors mix well together, with the sweetness of the candy balancing the sour spiciness of the other ingredients. And some say that the pickle is not bad, but nothing special.

    <div class="box1"> If you buy all the ingredients separately, the pickle can be constructed with food from most grocery stores.

    However, the pickle kit can also be bought all in one. Because this silly pickle surfaced on tik tok, most people buy the chamoy pickle kit off the tik tok shop. However, since not all of us have tik tok nor want to give it even more private information, you can also buy it on Amazon at a scarily high price!
