    It's actually quite simple. Take any old dill pickle, just your average joe, and soak it in a mixture of chamoy, Tajin, and sour candy powders. And, of course, some Red 40. Voila! If you're not sure what chamoy or Tajin are, Chamoy is a Mexican sauce made of dehydrated fruits, and Tajin is a Mexican spice made with a mixture of pepper, lime, and salt.

    But you may be confused: sure, it sounds interesting, but how did this mysterious invention come to light? And what makes it so special?

    The chamoy pickle became popular on Tik Tok. The pickle lore has to do with the combination of crazy flavors, bright colors, and the mess involved. To eat it properly, it should be stuffed with a variety of gummy candies and chips and be coated with even more chamoy. The more mess, the better the pickle! Finally, the sheer bucketload of Red 40 in the mixture helped draw attention to the pickle.
